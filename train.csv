The AP chest shows endotracheal tube tip at level of the carina and directed to the left main bronchus. New enteric tube tip projects just above the gastroesophageal junction. The left-sided approach PICC tip is unchanged. Sternotomy wires remain compatible prior surgery.
Bilateral patchy past views of the lungs remain compatible with airspace disease and atelectasis. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax is identified. The cardiothymic silhouette is similarly enlarged. The bones are unchanged.
Results were discussed with the PICU team at 4:00 PM on 7/6/2022. The PICU reports that the catheter since has been adjusted.

COMPARISON:
No comparisons
FINDINGS:
Supine frontal view of the chest including the abdomen shows endotracheal tube reaching good position above the carina. Patient has a cervical collar in place. Slightly hyperlucent appearance of the right lateral costophrenic angle noted which suggests a small basilar pneumothorax.. There is some scattered streaky opacity in the upper lungs medially and also in the left lower lobe. Given history of trauma, lung contusions cannot be excluded. Cardiac size is within normal limits. Pulmonary vasculature appears normal. No gross fractures can be identified on this single frontal view. The bowel gas pattern is nonobstructed.  The stomach may be distended as the bowel loops appears to be displaced inferiorly. Correlation clinically suggested.

Possible small basilar pneumothorax. Airspace disease in the upper lobes medially and left lower lobe and to a lesser extent in the left lower lung laterally. Given history of trauma, these may represent areas of contusions. Findings were discussed with the surgery service at 0822 hours on 5/28/2022.

Since prior examination,  All the supportive tubes and wires and lines are unchanged.  Aeration of the lungs have significantly improved with higher lung volumes. There is persistent patchy and hazy opacity noted in the right lung especially in perihilar region. There is asymmetric appearance of the pulmonary vasculature, with pulmonary interstitial edema on the right and there is no acute correlation of small right pleural effusion along the lateral apical region and also fluid in the minor fissure. Correlation clinically suggested. Right cardiac border is not well visualize and therefore difficult to assess the size of the cardiac silhouette. Stomach is distended with air.

Better aeration of lungs with higher lung volumes. Asymmetric interstitial edema on the right side with small right pleural effusion. Please correlate clinically.

FINDINGS:  The lungs are slightly hyperinflated. There are some scattered nonspecific diffuse small areas of patchy airspace disease noted which probably represent some scattered areas of atelectasis. There is peribronchial thickening noted. Overall appearance can be compatible with inflammatory airways disease/viral inflammatory process. No areas of airspace consolidation seen. Cardiothymic silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits. The stomach is distended predominantly with air and some fluid. There is a left-sided aortic arch.

FINDINGS:  Single frontal view of the chest shows hyperinflation of the lungs. There is small pneumomediastinum and large amount of subcutaneous air along the thoracic inlet and extending in the cervical region, supraclavicular areas bilaterally and also along the lower face.
In the lungs, there is airspace opacity noted in the right perihilar area and the right cardiac border is indistinct. There is also airspace disease in the lingula segment of the left upper lobe has a left lower cardiac border is also indistinct. These finding, on a single frontal view, would suggest airspace disease in right middle lobe and lingula segment of left upper lobe and pneumonia cannot be excluded. The rest of lungs are clear. Cardiac size and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits. There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion. There is a left-sided aortic arch.

Pneumomediastinum with large amount of subcutaneous air in the thoracic inlet, neck, and bilateral supraclavicular areas.
In the lungs, there is airspace disease in the right middle lobe and lingula segment of the left upper lobe that can be compatible with pneumonia.

FINDINGS:  Frontal view of the chest which included the abdomen shows radiopaque tubings superimposed over the chest which makes this examination suboptimal. Allowing for that, there is some patchy and streaky opacity noted in the left lower lobe in a fashion that is likely representing atelectasis. No definite areas of airspace consolidation is seen although visualization of the left lower lung is compromised. Cardiac size is within normal limits.
In the abdomen, bowel gas pattern appears normal.

Nonspecific patchy and streaky opacity in perihilar region and left lower lobe probably related to atelectasis. Please correlate clinically.

AP view the chest shows interval removal of the endotracheal tube. The right-sided chest tube, central venous catheter, epicardial pacer wires, sternotomy wires, and G-tube are unchanged.
New peripheral lucency is accompanied by mild rightward mediastinal shift. The appearance is compatible with a left tension pneumothorax. Increased right-sided opacities are compatible with increased right pulmonary volume loss. No pleural effusion is identified. The cardiothymic silhouette size is unchanged. The bones are normal.

FINDINGS:
Tip of endotracheal tube reaches near the origin the right mainstem bronchus with annotation at 7 cm. UVC is low in the expected region of the umbilical vein/left portal vein junction. UA catheter reaches level of T7-T8. Orogastric tube reaches left upper quadrant.
There is hazy and granular appearance to lung likely related to surfactant deficiency lung disease. More focal area of airspace opacity seen in the right perihilar area and right middle lobe and left lower lobe presumably related to more confluent atelectasis although infection cannot be entirely excluded radiographically. Correlation clinically suggested. There is no pneumothorax, pneumomediastinum, or pleural effusion. The axilla size is at the upper limits of normal. August pattern noted in the upper abdomen is normal. No vertebral body anomalies are seen on this radiograph.

Markedly increased pneumoperitoneum; the setting of code and positive pressure respiratory ventilation without a secured airway, this could represent gastric going into the GI tract and escaping via gastrostomy site or other perforation or tracking inferiorly through the mediastinum during tracheostomy ventilation/malpositioned tube.
Low lung volumes with basilar opacities likely atelectasis. Increased pneumomediastinum and extensive chest wall gas, possibly related to resuscitation versus pneumoperitoneum.

Slight interval repositioning of tracheostomy tube with tip position difficult to ascertain; per report this tube has been subsequently removed. Unchanged right pleural catheter and partially visualized gastrostomy tube. Unchanged left PICC with tip in the right atrium.
Markedly increased pneumoperitoneum; the setting of code and positive pressure respiratory ventilation without a secured airway, this could represent gastric going into the GI tract and escaping via gastrostomy site or other perforation or tracking inferiorly through the mediastinum during tracheostomy ventilation/malpositioned tube.
Low lung volumes with basilar opacities likely atelectasis. Increased pneumomediastinum and extensive chest wall gas, possibly related to resuscitation versus pneumoperitoneum.

FINDINGS:
Since earlier today,  All the supportive tubes and wires and lines are unchanged. Tip of endotracheal tube reaches at the level of the thoracic inlet. There is linear lucency along the right cervical region reaching the thoracic inlet level. Although there is no definite evidence for pneumomediastinum in the mediastinum, air in the soft tissue of the cervical region can suggest presence of pneumomediastinum. Correlation clinically suggested. Lung volumes continue to be low with some streaky atelectasis in the lung bases and also increased opacity in the right upper lobe also likely related to atelectasis. Cardiac size is within normal limits.
IMPRESSION:

FINDINGS:
Since prior examination, tip of endotracheal tube reaches near the origin the right mainstem bronchus with annotation at 7 cm. This finding has been reported to NICU attending at 1044 hours on 3/17/2022 and the endotracheal tube has been withdrawn back already.  Enteric tube is present and reaches beyond the margin of the film into the left side of the abdomen. Lung volumes are quite low and the left forearm and hand is positioned over the lower chest making this examination suboptimal. Cardiac silhouette size is enlarged but stable. Slight hazy appearance is noted in the lungs likely stable.

FINDINGS:
The patient is now intubated. Tip of the ET tube is about 2.8 cm above the carina.
There is an enteric tube and weighted feeding tube both with tip overlying the stomach bubble which is distended and not decompressed. Some of the side ports of the decompression tube appear to be above the GE junction.
There is abnormal cardiac silhouette in particular with right-sided possibly right atrial enlargement possibly related to congenital heart disease.
Coarse interstitial pattern noted in somewhat perihilar distribution bilaterally. There are some air bronchograms in the retrocardiac region.
Again noted is small amount of pneumomediastinum however slightly increased since the previous exam.
There also appear to be new bilateral small right and small-to-moderate left pneumothoraces.
There is extensive serpiginous air predominantly within the axillary and subclavicular regions.
Costophrenic angles are sharp..
IMPRESSION: Pneumomediastinum as well as new bilateral pneumothoraces.

STUDY:   X-RAY CHEST    REASON FOR EXAM:   Male, 4 years old.  intubation and NG placement    TECHNIQUE:   Single AP portable view of the chest was obtained    COMPARISON:   10/22/2022.  ___________________________________    FINDINGS:  The patient is now intubated. Tip of the ET tube is about 2.8 cm above the carina.    There is an enteric tube and weighted feeding tube both with tip overlying the stomach bubble which is distended and not decompressed. Some of the side ports of the decompression tube appear to be above the GE junction.    There is abnormal cardiac silhouette in particular with right-sided possibly right atrial enlargement possibly related to congenital heart disease.    Coarse interstitial pattern noted in somewhat perihilar distribution bilaterally. There are some air bronchograms in the retrocardiac region.    Again noted is small amount of pneumomediastinum however slightly increased since the previous exam.    There also appear to be new bilateral small right and small-to-moderate left pneumothoraces.    There is extensive serpiginous air predominantly within the axillary and subclavicular regions.    Costophrenic angles are sharp..    IMPRESSION: Pneumomediastinum as well as new bilateral pneumothoraces.    Lines and tubes as above.    Distended stomach. Further decompression may be helpful.    Perihilar predominantly interstitial opacities may be related to infectious/inflammatory process or possibly cardiogenic/edema related.

Chest radiographs 9/15/2022, 8/31/2022, 4/6/2022.

Frontal portable view of the chest was obtained. Patient is status post same day cardiothoracic surgery with interval associated change. Bilateral chest chest tubes are in place, with the tip of the right overlying the midline at T5 level and the tip of the left overlying the lateral left third rib. There are very small bilateral apical pneumothoraces. There is a pacemaker device and the leads are intact. Endotracheal tube tip is at the carina directed towards the right main bronchus within the tracheal tube annotation at 21 cm. Right jugular vein central venous catheter tip overlies the superior vena cava. No evidence of a pleural effusion. The cardiothymic silhouette remains appears slightly smaller. At the time that this critical result was discussed with the PICU fellow, the endotracheal tube had already been retracted 2 cm.

FINDINGS:
Since prior examination, endotracheal tube reaches just above the carina with annotation at 7 cm.  All the supportive tubes and wires and lines are unchanged.  UV catheter continues to be high in the chest possibly reaching the left atrium. This has been discussed with NICU attending physician, Dr. Dudell, at 0725 hours.
Aeration of lungs have improved with less degree of opacity throughout both lungs. The cardiac silhouette remains difficult to visualize due to presence of airspace disease. Airspace disease continue to involve most of the lungs with some spurring of the very peripheral portion of both lungs. Central opacities extending to the bilateral lower lungs especially on the left side and to a left upper lung is again seen with central air bronchograms. Cardiac silhouette size is likely enlarged but the cardiac borders are not well-visualized.


Slight improvement in aeration of the lungs.

Since prior examinations,  All the supportive tubes and wires and lines are unchanged.  Tip of endotracheal tube reaches just past the thoracic inlet unchanged. There is improvement in the aeration of the right upper lobe. There is less dense opacity seen although abnormal increase patchy opacity remains present in the right upper lobe and also there is some worsening aeration of the left upper lobe and more dense opacities noted in the left lower lobe. Overall lung volumes has slightly decreased. Allowing for rotation of patient, cardiac size is normal and stable.


Some improvement in aeration of the right upper lobe and worsening aeration of the left upper lobe and especially in the left lower lobe. These findings would suggest shifting atelectasis.

Since prior examination,  the orientation of the tracheostomy tube is different with the projection showing less amount of the tube projected over the tracheal air shadow. Suggest correlation clinically. If necessary, lateral view can be obtained.
Lung volumes are lower. There is more opacity seen in the perihilar region and bilateral upper lungs probably related to more atelectasis. Cardiac silhouette size is stable allowing for the lower lung volumes. Hyperexpansion right lower lung is again noted.
Gastrostomy button is present.

Compared to prior examination on 8/1/2022, the position of tracheostomy tube may have changed. While this could be related to projection of the radiograph, correlation clinically is needed. Findings were discussed with ICU fellow at 1114 hours and a lateral view of the neck will be obtained.

Given that the effusion is increased in size after thoracentesis, this raises suspicion for possible postprocedural hemorrhage into the pleural space. Recommend correlation with patient's symptoms and consider evaluation with cross-sectional imaging.

1/7/2022 at 0610 hours
FINDINGS:
Since prior examination, additional enteric tube has been placed but the tip of the tube is just beyond the margin of the film. Exact location of the CorFlo feeding tube cannot be determined on this portable chest film. The left PICC reaches across the mediastinum with the tip projected just underneath the right clavicle likely reaching the right subclavian vessel area. Correlation clinically suggested. Endotracheal tube is in good position past the thoracic inlet. Portion of the VP shunt is seen along the right chest. Aeration of lungs have significantly improved with less opacity seen in the left lung base, right upper lung and right lower lung. There is some residual opacity seen in the bilateral perihilar areas. Cardiac size is within normal limits allowing for the low lung volumes.


Improvement in aeration of the lungs.
Left PICC reaches to the right subclavian area.
On this chest film, eccentric position of the enteric tubes cannot be determined.
Location of supportive tubes have been discussed with fellow caring for the patient in the ICU at 0823 hours.

FINDINGS:
Since prior examination, double lumen left-sided central venous catheter has been removed. There is a right-sided central venous catheter reaching expected region of the right atrium. Lung volumes are much lower. There is dense airspace opacity in the left perihilar region and left lower lobe. Although this may be due to dense atelectasis with low lung volumes and elevated left hemidiaphragm, pneumonia cannot be excluded and correlation clinically is needed. Hazy appearance to the right perihilar region likely related to atelectasis and low lung volumes. Cardiac size is likely within normal limits allowing for the low lung volumes.

XR CHEST 1 VIEW AP  
INDICATION(S): 
s/p ECMO cannulation  
COMPARISON:
Portable chest film from earlier on the same day at 1013 hours
FINDINGS:
Since prior examination, a veno-veno-ECMO cannula has been placed with the tip reaching expected region of right atrium. The endotracheal tube reaches just past the thoracic inlet in good position; enteric tube barely reaches expected location stomach. There is a Cor-Flo feeding tube reaching expected region of the pylorus area. There is a right side chest tube. Medial pneumothorax persists and is slightly larger. The left pneumothorax pleural air has redistributed. It is accumulated in the more basal position and judging by the density, there is likely a hydropneumothorax. Of note is that the diaphragm appears to be more flattened and this can suggest a larger volume of hydropneumothorax. Correlation clinically suggested. There is a smaller component of medial pneumothorax on the left side when compared to prior examination. Persistent subcutaneous air is seen along the lower cervical region and left supraclavicular areas. Cardiac size is stable and not enlarged. More dense opacity
seen in the left lung. Continued dense opacity seen in the right lung.

The pneumothorax on the left side has redistributed with likely a hydropneumothorax which is probably slightly larger when compared to prior examination although this is difficult to assess given the redistribution all the pneumothorax. Slightly larger medial pneumothorax on the right side.
Findings were discussed with the PICU team at approximately 1203 hours.

COMPARISON: Portable chest film from outside institution from 4/20/2022 at 1102 hours
FINDINGS:  Portable frontal and lateral view of the chest shows significant airspace opacity in the right upper lung with significant elevation of the minor fissure suggesting volume loss of the right upper lung. There is complete loss of the left cardiac border with dense perihilar opacities. This can represent collapse of the left upper lobe. However, very aggressive development of pneumonia/consolidation cannot be completely excluded given that there has been approximately 3 days since prior examination and correlation clinically is needed. No pleural effusions are seen. Cardiac size cannot be assessed as the left cardiac border cannot be visualize.

Evidence of dense right upper lobe with loss of volume and complete loss of the left cardiac border which may represent collapse of the left upper lobe with dense airspace opacity in the perihilar region and air bronchograms. This may all represent collapse of bilateral upper lobes. However, given that there has been 3 days in time between the previous examination, clinical correlation and needed to ensure that this does not represent very aggressive development of pneumonia.

XR CHEST 2 VIEWS PA AND LATERAL  
INDICATION(S): 
pneumomediastinum  
COMPARISON:
Portable frontal and lateral view of the chest from yesterday at 1209 hours
FINDINGS:
Since prior examination yesterday, there is significant extension of mediastinal air into the upper mediastinum and into the cervical and facial area bilaterally. The air collection in the posterior mediastinum appears larger and the cardiac silhouette appears slightly more displaced to the left. However, patient is also rotated so therefore this is difficult to assess. There continues to be air collection in the right lung grossly unchanged. On the lateral view, there is also slightly more expansion of the posterior mediastinal air and perhaps slightly more impression upon the posterior aspect of the cardiac silhouette. Correlation clinically is needed.  Patient is not intubated. UA catheter reaches the level of T8-T9 and the UV catheter reaches to the expected region of the right atrium.

There is worsening appearance of the pneumomediastinum now extension to the upper chest and extending into the neck and face area. The posterior mediastinal air appears slightly larger although the frontal view is rotated and make this assessment more difficult. There is perhaps minimal more displacement of the cardiac silhouette anteriorly and to the left.
These findings were discussed with Dr. Carter of the NICU service at 0857 hours.

FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:
New endotracheal tube terminates at the mid thoracic trachea. Right IJ PA catheter has been advanced and terminates over the right lower lobe. Correlate with desired positioning. Impella has been removed. New LVAD over the cardiac apex. New radiopaque objects over the right aspect of the heart, possibly sponges. Correlate with operative history.
Cardiac silhouette enlargement with increase in conspicuity of the pulmonary vasculature, which could represent edema and/or vascular crowding in the setting of reduced lung volumes. No pneumothorax or pleural effusion.

FINDINGS:
Hardware: Enteric tube tip projects over the distal gastric lumen.
Lungs and pleural space: Similar background interstitial prominence with streaky perihilar predominant opacities and peribronchial thickening. No focal consolidation, pneumothorax or pleural effusion.
Heart and mediastinum: Unchanged.
Upper abdomen: Unremarkable.
Bones: Unchanged.
Subcutaneous: Unremarkable.

Similar appearance of the lungs which may represent a combination of small airways disease and atelectasis.
No new focal consolidation.

COMPARISON: KUB and chest x-ray 12/21/2022

FINDINGS/IMPRESSION:
2 chest wall port with catheter tips terminating in the cavoatrial junction. Right internal jugular central venous catheter tip projects in the low SVC. Status post sternotomy with anterior plate fusion hardware. Mediastinal clips. Endotracheal tube projects 5 cm above the carina.
Left chest tube with side holes partially projecting outside the pleural margins, better seen on same day KUB. Small left basilar pneumothorax, unchanged. Recommend correlation with chest tube function.
Small right pleural effusion. No definite right pneumothorax.
Right greater than left lower lung predominant nodular and hazy opacities with air bronchograms. Findings are favored to represent multifocal pneumonia, although pulmonary edema is possible.
Unchanged cardiomediastinal silhouette.
