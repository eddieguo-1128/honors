Since prior examination,  All the supportive tubes and wires and lines are unchanged.  There is a radiopaque wire that is draped over the upper chest making this examination suboptimal. A very subtle area of medial pneumothorax on the left side cannot be entirely excluded and upper mediastinum and along the left upper cardiac border. Correlation clinical is suggested. Repeat radiographs with the radiopaque wire removed from the front of the chest would be helpful for further evaluation if clinically deemed indicated. There continues to be some patchy airspace opacity in the bilateral perihilar region and in the right midlung area.

INDICATION: Age:  25 days Gender:  Male. History:  c/f Diaphragmatic hernia
COMPARISON: Chest and abdomen film from outside institution yesterday at 2016 hours and abdominal films
FINDINGS:  2 views of the chest shows persistent elevation of the left hemidiaphragm laterally on the frontal view and on the lateral view, is noted to be anterior and there is a bowel loop immediately underneath what possibly could be a diaphragm versus eventration versus focal hernia through the diaphragm. Small left pleural effusion persists. There continues to be patchy and streaky opacity near left upper lobe and also in the left lower lung. Although these area could be related to atelectasis, pneumonia cannot be excluded and correlation clinically is needed. Cardiothymic silhouette is slightly shifted to the right side. Right lung is hyperinflated and clear. There is likely a left-sided aortic arch. The stomach appears to be in the left upper quadrant.

 Persistent elevation of the left diaphragm with bowel loop immediately beneath that. This appearance is in the lateral anterior aspect which is somewhat unusual for diaphragmatic hernia although this diagnosis cannot be excluded. Eventration of the diaphragm is a possibility.
Airspace disease in the left upper lobe and left lower lung with small left pleural effusion. Although this may be atelectasis, pneumonia cannot be excluded and correlation clinically suggested.
These findings have been discussed with emergency room fellow and also discussed with surgery service and shown to surgery service. Follow-up CT scan as per request by surgery service will be performed.

FINDINGS:
Since prior examination from 2/28/2020, there is slight hyperinflation of the lungs. There is some patchy and streaky opacity in the right lower lobe medially and also in the perihilar regions. Slight increased interstitial marking in perihilar region may represent a mild degree of nonspecific peribronchial thickening. These are likely areas of scattered atelectasis. Of note is that in the upper mediastinum, the thymus is well demarcated. This would suggest presence of small pneumomediastinum. Correlation clinically suggested. There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Cardiac size and pulmonary vasculature is within normal limits.

Hyperinflation with scattered atelectasis can represent inflammatory airways disease. No areas of airspace consolidation.
Of note is that the thymus appears well delineated which may suggest presence of a small pneumomediastinum.

Since a few minutes earlier, the stiffener has been removed from the CorFlo feeding tube. The stomach is less distended. Unfortunately, the exact location of the tip of the tube is still difficult to assess although it and may have reached the fourth portion of duodenum. There could be a area of kink at the distal end of the tube. Suggestion of injection of 5 mL of water-soluble contrast material and repeat abdominal film as discussed with resident caring for the patient at 1610 hours. No other interval changes.

Portable chest from from 4/13/2022 at 1204 hours
FINDINGS:
Since yesterday's chest film, the enteric tube has been removed and a echo feeding tube has been placed. The tip of the tube is likely looped in the third portion of the duodenum with the tip pointed retrograde and there is a slight kink of the tube. Correlation with functioning of the tube is suggested. Finding has been communicated to ICU fellow caring for the patient at 0755 hours. The rest of the supportive tubes and wires and lines are stable with endotracheal tube reaching good position above the carina.
Lung volumes have improved slightly. There is still persistent patchy and streaky opacity in the right lung and also in the left upper lung and left perihilar area and left lower lung. The peripheral aspect of the left lung has improved aeration.  Cardiac size is at the upper limits of normal. No pleural effusions are seen.

CorFlo feeding tube likely reaches the third portion duodenum but it is redundant and pointed retrograde with a kink in the tube. This finding has been reported to PICU fellow at 0755 hours.
Slightly better aeration of the lungs noted.

FINDINGS: Supine frontal view of the chest including the abdomen but not the pelvis demonstrate no radiopaque foreign body. Airway appears normal. There is some minor streaky opacity in the left base and on this frontal view, there is slight hyperexpansion of the medial aspect of the right lower lobe. This may be a nonspecific finding. However, given the history of possible inhaled foreign body, clinical correlation for physical exam findings related to expansion of the right lower lobe is suggested. The cardiothymic silhouette and pulmonary vasculature are within normal limits. No pleural effusion or pneumothorax or pneumomediastinum is seen.
The bowel gas pattern upper abdomen is normal.

No radiopaque foreign body noted.
Slight asymmetry in aeration with a focal distention of the medial aspect of the right lower lung. Although this is a nonspecific finding, given history of possible inhaled foreign body, clinical correlation is suggested for symptoms related to the right lower lobe area.

HISTORY: s/p chest tube placement
COMPARISON: Chest radiograph 1/20/2022 and 1/21/2022
FINDINGS:
Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube, the tip overlies the base of the right lung. Significant interval decrease in size of right pleural effusion with no air in the right pleural space without significant reexpansion of the lung parenchyma most compatible with trapped lung physiology. There is near complete opacification of the partially collapsed right lung, which reflects atelectasis as well as an airspace disease process.
Left pleural effusion and adjacent subsegmental atelectasis again noted. Left retrocardiac opacity again noted.
The right-sided PICC line is unchanged in location. Redemonstration of a percutaneously inserted enteric tube, the tip is below the diaphragm and outside of the field of view. Unchanged position of esophageal stent.

IMPRESSION:
1. Interval placement of a right-sided chest tube with decrease in right pleural effusion and new right pneumothorax without significant reexpansion of the lung suggestive of trapped lung physiology.
2. Near complete opacification of the partially collapsed right lung, likely reflects atelectasis as well as airspace disease process.
3. Left pleural effusion and adjacent subsegmental atelectasis. Left retrocardiac opacity likely represents atelectasis and/or airspace disease process such as aspiration or infection.

COMPARISON:

FINDINGS:
Since prior examination,  All the supportive tubes and wires and lines are unchanged.  Endotracheal tube is in good position past the thoracic inlet with annotation at 10 cm. Echo venous-venous cannula is stable with appropriate orientation from a frontal radiograph projection. There is very minimal amorphous subtle lucency seen to the right of midline likely related to minimal amount of aeration in the medial aspect of the right mid lung. Otherwise, there is complete opacification of both lungs. Cardiac borders cannot be visualized.

Since yesterday portable chest film, the venous-venous ECMO cannula is stable in its orientation. There is slight aeration of the right mid-lower lung medially.

2 views of the chest show minimally decreased density of right upper and left perihilar linear opacities. The change likely reflects evolution of previously described airspace disease, atelectasis and/or scarring. No new pulmonary parenchymal abnormality is identified. No pleural effusion is observed. The cardiothymic silhouette and bones are normal.
